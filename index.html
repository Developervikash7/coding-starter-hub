    <main> Here we talk about coding</main>
    <p>Coding is the process of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform specific tasks. It helps us build websites, apps, games, and software that solve real-world problems. By learning coding, we develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills. In today’s digital world, coding is not just for developers — it is a powerful skill that allows anyone to create, innovate, and turn ideas into reality.</p>

<article>Coding is the language through which humans communicate with computers. It allows us to create websites, mobile applications, software, and even advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. Every digital platform we use today—whether it is social media, online shopping, or banking—exists because of coding.

Learning to code not only opens doors to high-paying career opportunities but also improves logical thinking and problem-solving skills. It teaches patience, creativity, and the ability to break complex problems into smaller steps. In today’s fast-growing digital world, coding is no longer just a technical skill; it is becoming a basic literacy for the future.

By practicing regularly and building small projects, anyone can start their journey into coding and gradually turn ideas into real-world solutions.</article>
